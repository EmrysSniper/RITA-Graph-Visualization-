Group 49 (Similar Causes of Accidents):

File: 100440.pdf
Cause:
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The airplane’s degraded performance due to high-density altitude and gusting wind conditions, 
which resulted in its inability to maintain altitude during the initial takeoff climb. Contributing 
to the accident was the pilot’s lack of experience with high altitude flying and his decision to 
depart in high-density altitude and gusting wind conditions.

Group 124 (Similar Causes of Accidents):

File: 94748.pdf
Cause:
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the fuel selector valve in a position that restricted fuel flow to the engine, 
resulting in a total loss of engine power during initial climb due to fuel starvation. Also causal 
was the operator's failure to effectively detect and resolve the wear and progressive binding of 
the fuel selector valve before it failed due to excessive rotational force being applied. 
Contributing was the flight instructor's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack 
during an emergency return to the airport, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall/spin.
